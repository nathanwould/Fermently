MVP/PostMVP
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

MVP
These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.

Find and use external api
Render data on page
Allow user to choose favorites
PostMVP
These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.

Add second API
Use local storage to save user favorites
Project Schedule
This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

Day	Deliverable	Status
July 10-12	Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes	Incomplete
July 13	Project Approval	Incomplete
July 13	Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.)	Incomplete
July 14	Pseudocode / actual code	Incomplete
July 15	Initial Clickable Model	Incomplete
July 16	MVP	Incomplete
July 17	Presentations	Incomplete
Timeframes
Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

Component	Priority	Estimated Time	Time Invested	Actual Time
Adding Form	H	3hrs	3.5hrs	3.5hrs
Working with API	H	3hrs	2.5hrs	2.5hrs
Total	H	6hrs	5hrs	5hrs
